    <p> I would absolutly love to visit Australia. I have already visited it with the Colorado Childrens Choral in my eighth grade year but I felt as if it wasn't enough time to see all that I wanted to see. 
      It's such a peicful place where you rarely see mean face. I love to see their different culture and the way they view things differently then Americans.</p>
